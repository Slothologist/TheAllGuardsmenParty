# The All Guardsmen Party
Shoggy's popular Warhammer 40k fan fiction in book form. 
Originally published on /tg/ and [Shoggy's webseite](http://www.theallguardsmenparty.com/), this is a recollection of a Dark Heresy campaign. 

This story contains the adventures of guardsmen Sarge, Twitch, Nubby, Tink, Cutter, Doc and many others as they embark on quests for their Inquisitor Professor Oak. 

## Release Notes
I compiled this form of the story to be able to read the story on an eReader on vacation without internet.
Re-publicating here with Shoggy's permission.
I'll add chapters over the next weeks, and then as they are released.

### Some design decisions for the tex files
* Each sentence gets it's own line. Makes subsequent editing easier.
* I have no idea how to exactly transport the greentext parts into book form. The title drops for each chapter are left out at the moment becasue they are a bit superflous. 
* Pictures are subject to resizing. At the moment I feel a third of the text width to be okay for the pics that are more high then wide, but a bit too small for wider pictures.
